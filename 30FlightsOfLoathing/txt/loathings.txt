15
NOBODY LIKES ME
NO ONE LOVES ME
I DO NOT MATTER
I AM DISGUSTING
I SICKEN MYSELF
I DETEST MYSELF

20
I AM WORTHLESS TRASH
MY LIFE IS POINTLESS
I AM A WASTE OF TIME

25
THEY ALL SEE ME AS A JOKE
I AM JUST A WASTE OF TIME
NO ONE COULD EVER LOVE ME
EVERYTHING IS MEANINGLESS
MY LIFE IS A WASTE OF AIR
I DO NOT DESERVE ANY LOVE
I DO NOT DESERVE ANY HELP

30
I DO NOT DESERVE ANY HAPPINESS
IT HAS ALL AMOUNTED TO NOTHING
I HAVE GOT NOTHING TO LIVE FOR
I WILL NEVER ADD UP TO ANYTHING











I AM A WASTE OF SPACE
I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP
NOBODY LIKES ME TO BE AROUND
I WISH I HAD NOT BEEN BORN
I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP
I WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
NOBODY WILL EVER REALLY LOVE ME
